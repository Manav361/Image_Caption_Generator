## Introduction

The Image Caption Generator is a project that aims to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. It uses a deep learning approach, combining CNNs to extract image features and Transformers to generate text-based captions. This can be particularly useful for applications like image indexing, accessibility, and more.

## Features

- Automatic generation of textual captions for images.
- Integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
- Flexibility to work with various image datasets.
- Easy-to-use API for generating captions from images.

## Demo
